# Projects 21 and 22


# Overview for project21 (main branch)

Project21: Use ansible playbook to create complete VPC stack on AWS2. Note using an EC2 instance with ansible, botocore, boto3 and aws cli v2, python3,pip installed. Use IAM role attached to ansible EC2 instance for authentication.


## Software version control

Create a local workspace on VSCode so that the yml playbook files can be easily edited.

Create the remote repository and push the code to the remote repository

initialize git on the project folder on the ansible-EC2-project21 folder home/ubuntu/vpc-stack-vprofile and git remote add origin to the remote git repository above.

For the vars/output_vars_IDs file, this file is created on ansible-EC2-project21 only. 
After it is created on the ansible EC2 instance do: git push origin main to remote github repo
Then do: git pull origin main on the VSCode workspace. 
This needs to be updated each time prior to running the bastion-instance.yml that sets up the bastion host on the VPC
This is required because the bastion-instance.yml imports the vars/output_vars_IDs file in order to set up the bastion host on the VPC and 
in the public subnet (subnet number 1 will be used)
The local VSCode does not need to be updated with latest output_vars_IDs (not mandatory)

Use debug module throughout the playbook to help troubleshoot any syntax coding issues.





# Create output of all the IDs for the objects above so that we can use the IDs to create a bastion host

The code below is for this purpose. This is in the vpc-setup.yml ansible playbook:
- debug:
        var: "{{item}}"

      loop:
      # list all the ID's you want to store in the vars file
      # This will print out in debug
        - vpcoutvariable.vpc.id
        - pubsub1_out_variable.subnet.id
        - pubsub2_out_variable.subnet.id
        - pubsub3_out_variable.subnet.id
        - privsub1_out_variable.subnet.id
        - privsub2_out_variable.subnet.id
        - privsub3_out_variable.subnet.id
        - igw_out_variable.gateway_id
        - publicroutingtable_out_variable.route_table.id
        - NATGW_out_variable.nat_gateway_id
        - privateroutingtable_out_variable.route_table.id


    - set_fact:
    # set the ids above as fact variables
        vpcid: "{{vpcoutvariable.vpc.id}}"
        pubsub1id: "{{ pubsub1_out_variable.subnet.id }}"
        pubsub2id: "{{ pubsub2_out_variable.subnet.id }}"
        pubsub3id: "{{ pubsub3_out_variable.subnet.id }}"
        privsub1id: "{{ privsub1_out_variable.subnet.id }}"
        privsub2id: "{{ privsub2_out_variable.subnet.id }}"
        privsub3id: "{{ privsub3_out_variable.subnet.id }}"
        igwid: "{{ igw_out_variable.gateway_id }}"
        pubRTid: "{{ publicroutingtable_out_variable.route_table.id }}"
        NATGWid: "{{ NATGW_out_variable.nat_gateway_id }}"
        privRTid: "{{ privateroutingtable_out_variable.route_table.id }}"
        cacheable: yes
        # cacheable means that these vars are added to fact cache.
        # These permit the ids to be used during runtime execution of the playbooks.


    - name: Create variables file for vpc output IDs
      copy:
        content: "vpcid: {{vpcoutvariable.vpc.id}}\npubsub1id: {{ pubsub1_out_variable.subnet.id }}\npubsub2id: {{ pubsub2_out_variable.subnet.id }}\npubsub3id: {{ pubsub3_out_variable.subnet.id }}\nprivsub1id: {{ privsub1_out_variable.subnet.id }}\nprivsub2id: {{ privsub2_out_variable.subnet.id }}\nprivsub3id: {{ privsub3_out_variable.subnet.id }}\nigwid: {{ igw_out_variable.gateway_id }}\npubRTid: {{ publicroutingtable_out_variable.route_table.id }}\nNATGWid: {{ NATGW_out_variable.nat_gateway_id }}\nprivRTid: {{ privateroutingtable_out_variable.route_table.id }}\n"
        dest: vars/output_vars_IDs


Ultimately the vars/output_vars_IDs will be used for the second ansible playbook to create the bastion host.



# Create the playbook for the bastion host bastion-instance.yml

This will use the vars/output-vars_IDs from above as well as variables in bastion_setup file (ami id, etc)

Note ec2 module is deprecated. Must use the ec2_instance module.

Use this reference to construct the ec2_instance module task in the bastion-instance.yml file
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/amazon/aws/ec2_instance_module.html

For the pem rsa security key make sure to store it one directory up from the repository directory in the ansible-EC2-project21 instance

This is the ec2_instance module task

# Overview for project22 (vprofile-stack-phase2 branch)

Project22: Phase2 of project21. With VPC stack, provision private subnets for backed servers for 
application, security groups for them, bastion host, EC2 instances for rabbitmq, memcached, mysql, t
omcat, nginx, and a front end Applicaton loadbalancer, All using Ansible playbooks for project3 lift 
and shift style rollout.

On public subnet create application LB
Private subnets: create security groups and subnets for the backend servers
2 private subnets (for nginix front end, tomcat, rabbitmq, Memcached, mysql)
Bastion host and new key pairs
This will compelte the infrastructure and the setup will be ready for phase3, deployment of the services and the application (.war from source)
to the infrastucture.


## Software version control

Will be the same as phase 1 using the ansible-EC2-project21 instance to run the actual ansibile-playbook command
on the various playbooks.  The branches in the respository are the following:
main(phase1) 
vprofile-stack-phase2 
vprofile-stack-phase3

Use a git push from VSCode to github repo and git pull on the ansible-EC2-project21 instance to update the
code on the ansible controller instance.


## Backend server implementation and provisioning requirements:

The objectives for phase2 are:

Fetch source code project21
Execute VPC playbook
New playbooks to launch EC2, ELB sec grp for vprofile, and keypairs


Ansible as a controller uses SSH to push configurations to nodes.
To get into Vprofile/application backend servers on the private subnet, a bastion host must be used with an interface on the private subnet. 
Ansible controller ansible-EC2-project21 is in default VPC, so must use bastion host or launch controller in the private VPC
For this project we will use a bastion host.
Once in the private subnet of the VP, we can write playbooks for vprofile stack setup
AWS VPC peering is another option but too complex for the scope of this implemenatation.



Ansible uses SSH to the backend. Can’t do this from the ansible VPC so will have to use a bastion host.
